    <h1>The 2025 Seville Agenda for Collective Resilience* in a Post-SDG Era</h1>
    <div id="sunburst"></div>
    <div class='card'><h2>The 2025 Seville Agenda for Collective Resilience  in a Post-SDG Era * * The capacity to withstand or to recover quickly from difficulties; toughness TABLE OF CONTENTS 1  Introduction  2 2  Resilience in a Complex World  3 3  Resilient Community Dimensions  3 4  Participatory Recalibration  4 5  Science and Technology as Catalyst  5 6  Financing Resilience  6 7  A Collective Mandate  6 8  Policy Roadmap for Resilience-Based Global Development (2025-2030)  8 9  Resilience & Global Development Policies: A Cross-Cutting Approach  11 1 1  Introduction 2025 marks a pivotal moment for the future of global development and cooperation. A decade after the UN Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) set forth a framework for financing  sustainable  progress,  and  with  just  five  years  remaining  until  the  2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) deadline, the world is on the cusp of a renewed vision  for financing the future. While challenges remain, this moment is defined by urgency  and  opportunity,  a  chance  to  reshape  the  financial  landscape  to  foster resilience, innovation, and inclusive growth.</h2><p>The Global South is central to this transformation, driving bold health, sustainability, and economic initiatives. With fast-growing economies and expertise in crisis resilience, countries across  Africa,  Latin  America,  and  Asia  are  pioneering  investment  models,  leveraging technology, and strengthening South-South cooperation. However, real and lasting progress requires global collaboration, forging equitable partnerships that promote shared knowledge, joint  investment,  and  sustainable  innovation.  By  working  together,  we,  as  global community,  need  to  develop  financing  structures  that  not  only  address  immediate challenges  but  also  build  long-term resilience, fostering inclusive economic growth, technological advancements and generates social benefits for all.</p><p>The  Fourth  International  Conference  on  Financing  for  Development  (FfD4) Conference  in  Sevilla  in  June  2025  represents  a  landmark  opportunity to solidify this momentum. Rather than a moment of crisis, it is a moment of action, where leaders from all sectors—governments, the private sector, philanthropy, and multilateral institutions—can work together to unlock new financing mechanisms that align investment flows with global development priorities. A core focus of this effort is health research and innovation, ensuring that financing structures enable the scaling of life-saving medical breakthroughs, pandemic preparedness, and universal healthcare solutions that reach every corner of the world.</p><p>Rather than seeing the SDGs as a fading ambition, this is the moment to transform them into an enduring legacy— a foundation for a new era of collaboration, where the global south is not just a participant in shaping global health and development but a leader driving forward a vision of shared progress, sustainability, and human well-being for generations to come.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>2 2  Resilience in a Complex World The global landscape is increasingly shaped by policies and institutions that must adapt to rapid changes, while at the same time, local communities are raising their voices, demanding participation and recognition in decision-making processes. The interconnectedness of our world causes that events in one region have repercussions in others, reinforcing the need for inclusive and collaborative approaches to resilience and development.</h2><p>Ongoing crises have exposed deeper silos in policymaking. Economic, health, culture, and climate action demonstrate our lack of readiness for the ripple effects that jump from one domain to the next. Even well-conceived programmes can operate alone, be reactive rather than anticipatory, failing to harness local expertise along the way.</p><p>This fragmentation calls for a unifying framework that acknowledges the full complexity of global challenges and the heritage of the existing efforts—especially as the mid-decade pivot arrives. Resilience, once seen as a byword for weathering discrete shocks, must become the central organising logic behind how we shape policy, direct investment, and engage communities.</p><p>Under  collective  Resilience,  we  shift  from  fragmented,  short-term  fixes  to  a  cohesive, future-facing plan that harnesses international science and local ingenuity.</p><p>At its core, resilience ensures that societies can withstand and adapt to crises while advancing  economic  and  social  progress.  Whether  it  be  pandemic  preparedness, climate shocks, economic instability, or geopolitical disruptions, resilience-focused financing ensures that countries—particularly those in the global south—are not just responding to crises but are structurally empowered to anticipate, absorb, and recover from shocks while sustaining long-term growth and well-being.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>3  Resilient Community Dimensions Resilience is not only a human challenge but also an ecological necessity. A development model that prioritizes economic growth at the expense of the environment is ultimately self-defeating, as it risks breaching planetary boundaries—critical ecological thresholds that regulate Earth's stability, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and freshwater use.</h2><p>Exceeding these limits undermines the very ecosystems that sustain human societies, leading to irreversible environmental degradation, resource depletion, and increased vulnerability to global crises such as extreme weather events, food insecurity, and pandemics. Sustainable development must operate within these boundaries to ensure long-term resilience for both human and natural systems.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>3 A diverse coalition comprising experts from the newly launched Lancet Commission on US Societal Resilience in a Global Pandemic Age, former government officials, leaders of the UN Science Summit, and ecological resilience examined existing tools to find common ground that could build on existing frameworks while allowing for expansion and evolution.</h2><p>What is emerging is a set of core principles and dimensions that offer a potential holistic step forward.   We  call  these  the  Resilient  Community  Dimensions  (RCD).  Rather  than overshadowing the SDGs, community resilience frameworks, or Planetary Boundaries, RCDs integrate these and related global initiatives into a dynamic, adaptive system—serving as both an address and a navigation tool that harmonizes global imperatives with local realities.</p><p>From  the  integration  of  existing  knowledge,  seven  interlinked  Resilient  Community Dimensions emerge: 1.  Environmental Stewardship & Resource Security 2.  Social Equity & Well-being 3.  Economic Vitality & Diversity 4.  Governance & Civic Engagement 5.  Infrastructure & Built Environment 6.  Cultural Vitality & Heritage 7.  Knowledge & Learning We believe that these principles, dimensions, and transitions offer a new path and grounding for genuine convergence—aligning science-based targets to protect our global commons with implementable roadmaps that promote community resilience 4  Participatory Recalibration A unique value of the RCD method lies in a dynamic bottom-up ethos, now truly enabled by an intelligent and connected world. Under this framework, local actors—from municipal officials  to  neighbourhood  associations—help  define,  refine  and  report  on  dimensions, verifiable metrics and measurements, bridging scientific models with on-the-ground sensing and insights, evolving a global societal platform with locally usable maps and directions.</p><p>For example, a coastal region vulnerable to sea-level rise might prioritise coral stewardship, shoreline restoration and flood defences, while an inland farming community might focus on water efficiency and crop diversification. Such adaptability ensures the framework remains 4 responsive to shifting risks and fosters genuine buy-in among communities, a prerequisite for meaningful change.</p><p>We must work in tandem with local knowledge systems, fostering a respectful collaboration that  acknowledges  traditional  ecological  wisdom  while  leveraging  technological advancements.</p><p>Ultimately,  the  integration of scientific expertise with indigenous and community-based knowledge can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions, ensuring that development benefits all members of society without compromising future generations.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>5  Science and Technology as Catalyst Science  and  technology  serve  as  the  foundation  of  resilient  societies, offering scalable, sustainable, and accessible solutions to global challenges and ensuring continuous adaptation and progress.</h2><p>By providing scalable and accessible tools, such as digital infrastructure for remote education, precision agriculture for food security, and climate modeling for disaster preparedness, S&T ensures that resilience is not just a reactive process but an ongoing, strategic approach to societal development. Moreover, by integrating scientific research with policy-making and community engagement, technology-driven resilience promotes equitable solutions, ensuring that all populations benefit from progress.</p><p>Additionally,  science  and  technology  allow  knowledge  exchange  and  learning  from Communities that possess rich traditions, innovative solutions, and adaptive strategies that benefit all of us in facing the global socio-economic and environmental challenges. Science and technology enable this global-local connections at an unprecedented scale facilitating the exchange of collective intelligence.</p><p>For example, smartphones, the internet of connected things and the blossoming market of mobile tools can empower citizens to report real-time data on air quality or public health access while artificial intelligence processes these inputs into actionable insights. Distributed ledger technology (blockchain, NFTs) can bring transparency to funding flows, building trust in how resources are deployed without central authority managing individual transactions.</p><p>As  global  challenges  become  more  complex,  integrating  scientific  advancements  into governance, education, and industry will be crucial for creating societies that are not only reactive to crises but also proactively equipped to navigate uncertainties with agility and robustness.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>5 6  Financing Resilience Policy imperatives alone will not drive transformation without the appropriate financial engine. With crises intensifying and investment communities increasingly aware of systemic risks,  the  upcoming  decadal  United  Nations  Financing  for  Development  (FfD4)  2025 Conference in Seville is a pivotal opportunity. Development banks, institutional investors, and philanthropic organisations recognise that resilience and sustainability are not optional but integral to stable long-term returns.</h2><p>Innovative  financial  instruments—resilience  bonds,  blended  finance  models,  and public-private partnerships—can help bring the RCD framework to life globally. During the conference’s  side  event  on  Resilience,  the  Seville  Declaration  on  Collective Resilience will be introduced, articulating a shared vision and setting up a global task force  to  guide  RCD’s  rollout  and  evolution  to  support  communities  living  within  and protecting our shared planetary boundaries.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>7  A Collective Mandate This proposal is championed by a broad alliance—medical leaders contending with pandemic realities, former policymakers seasoned by the demands of government, global scientists and climate  experts,  frontline  workers  and  community  advocates  of  ecological  stewardship —underscoring just how interwoven today’s challenges genuinely are.</h2><p>We invite the public, legislators, executives, investors, and civil society to join this effort. By embedding resilience in every policy and budget line, we can forge a path that weathers the crises at our global doorstep and builds a more equitable, sustainable world. Time is of the essence. As 2025 ushers in a new era of uncertainty and opportunity, let us seize the moment to reimagine how we safeguard and advance our shared future.</p><p>A  resilience-focused  agenda  at  the  Fourth  International  Conference  on  Financing  for Development (FfD4) in 2025 has the potential to shape the global development landscape for years to come, influencing key international meetings such as UNGA80 in September 2025 and the UN Social Summit in Doha in 2026. By prioritising financial and structural resilience, FfD4 can lay the groundwork for a new era of sustainable, equitable, and inclusive global development financing.</p><p>By embedding resilience into development financing frameworks at FfD4, the conference's outcomes can directly inform and influence the policy debates at UNGA80 in September 2025. As world leaders gather for this milestone General Assembly session, the discussions will be shaped by the urgent need to bridge the financing gaps hindering progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>6 FfD4’s emphasis on resilient financing models can drive commitments at UNGA80 to secure long-term funding for universal health coverage, strengthen pandemic response capacities, and integrate resilience into climate adaptation strategies. The momentum from FfD4 can also catalyze stronger cooperation between multilateral institutions, private sector investors, and development banks, ensuring that financing commitments at UNGA80 translate into concrete actions and implementation strategies.</h2><p>Looking ahead to the UN Social Summit in Doha in 2026, resilience financing will be critical to  shaping  discussions  on  the  future  of  social  protection,  inclusive  economies,  and equity-driven policies. The Social Summit will be a defining moment to reimagine global social  contracts,  and  FfD4  can  provide  the  financial  blueprints  needed  to  make social protection systems more robust, universal, and adaptable to evolving global challenges. By establishing innovative financing mechanisms at FfD4, such as solidarity levies, global health investment funds, and debt restructuring models, the conference can equip policymakers in Doha with the financial tools necessary to implement social protection reforms that reach marginalized communities, strengthen workforce resilience, and promote inclusive economic opportunities.</p><p>Furthermore, FfD4’s resilience focus can influence broader discussions on global governance, South-South  and  South-North  cooperation,  and  private  sector engagement across these future summits. By shifting the global financing paradigm toward long-term sustainability rather than crisis-driven responses, the outcomes of FfD4 can help create a more stable, predictable, and equitable financial architecture that supports nations in achieving lasting development gains well beyond 2030.</p><p>Ultimately, FfD4 is a standalone event and a pivotal moment to reshape how global resources are  mobilised,  distributed,  and  sustained  to  ensure  resilience  across  health  systems, economies, and social infrastructures. The commitments made in 2025 will echo throughout UNGA80, the Social Summit in Doha, and beyond, ensuring that resilience becomes the foundation for the next phase of global development.</p></div>
<div class='card'><h2>7 8  Policy  Roadmap  for  Resilience-Based  Global Development (2025-2030) This roadmap builds on the Seville Agenda for Collective Resilience, outlining a structured, five-year strategy that aligns policy, financing, data infrastructure, and innovation to support developing nations, strengthen global cooperation, and shape the post-SDG development agenda.</h2><p>The roadmap highlights health resilience as a core priority while ensuring a holistic approach that includes economic, environmental, and social dimensions.
